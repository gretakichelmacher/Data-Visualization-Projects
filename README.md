### 1) **Predict students' dropout and academic success**. 
The objective of this personal project has been to tackle the problem of students dropping out and not finishing their studies. A dashboard (developed using R) has been used to discover the main insights and patterns in the data. This dashboard take a lot of different information—from students' school performance to their personal backgrounds—and make it easy to understand. This way, it is possible to see the bigger picture and get at the heart of general aspects of students’ dropout. The dataset is available here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success .
